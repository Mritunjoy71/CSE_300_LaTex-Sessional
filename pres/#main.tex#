\begin{columns}

\begin{block}{Cycle}
In graph theory, a cycle is a path of edges and vertices wherein a vertex is reachable from itself.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Hamiltonian Circuit}
A Hamiltonian circuit,also known as Hamiltonian cycle,  is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once (except for the vertex that is both the start and end, which is visited twice).

\begin{itemize}
\onslide<1,7>{
\setbeamercovered{transparent}
\item The Hamiltonian cycle is named after Sir William Rowan Hamilton.
}
\onslide<2,7>{
\setbeamercovered{transparent}
\item He devised a puzzle in which such a path along the polyhedron edges of an dodecahedron was sought (the Icosian game).
}
\onslide<3,7>{
\setbeamercovered{transparent}
\item The Icosian Game was invented in 1857.
}
\onslide<4,7>{
\setbeamercovered{transparent}
\item The Icosian game is the problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle along the edges of an dodecahedron, i.e., a path such that every vertex is visited a single time, no edge is visited twice, and the ending point is the same as the starting point.
}
\onslide<5,7>{
\setbeamercovered{transparent}
\item Hamilton sold it to a London game dealer in 1859 for 25 pounds.
}
\onslide<6,7>{
\setbeamercovered{transparent}
\item the game was subsequently marketed in Europe in a number of forms (Gardner 1957).

\frametitle{Finding Hamiltonian Cycle in Graphs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In general, the problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle is NP-complete.
    \pause
    \item So,the only known way to determine whether a given general graph has a Hamiltonian cycle is to undertake an exhaustive search.
\end{itemize}

    A brute force algorithm.Tests n! different sequences of vertices that might be Hamiltonian paths in a given n-vertex graph.

\begin{block}{Algorithm of Rubin}
    A search procedure that divides the edges of the graph into three classes: those that must be in the path, those that cannot be in the path, and undecided. As the search proceeds, a set of decision rules classifies the undecided edges, and determines whether to halt or continue the search.
